# Machine-learning-lab
This repository contains code for various machine learning model built during Machine learning lab

## Assignment 1

Basic python code for understanding libraries such as numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit etc.

## Assignment 2

Basic python code to illustrate statistical operations such as variance, covariance, mean, median, mode and pearson correlation cofficient

## Assignment 3

Implementation of a linear regression algorithm to approximate a one variable and multivariable function. Illustration of training done using both least square method and gradient descent is present. <br>
Implementing and training a linear regression model on **Boston Housing dataset** to predict the house prices


## Assignment 4

1. Ilustration of curve fitting of various polynomial function of different degree on a single training set.
2. Implementing a logistic regression model on **Wisconsin breast cancer dataset** to classify data samples as Benign or Malignant tumor. <br>
    **Todo:** Increase the accuracy of the model, currently on average around 62% accuracy
    
 ## Assignment 5
 
 1. Implementing AND logical gate and OR logical gate using **single layer perceptron**.
 2. Implementing **Naive Bayesian** algorithm on **Wisconsin breast cancer dataset** to classify data samples as Benign or Malignant Tumor.
 
 ## Assignment 6
 
1. Classification on **IRIS** dataset using a single layer perceptron
2. Classification on **IRIS** dataset using a multi layer perceptron (MLP)


## Assignment 7
K mean clustering on **IRIS** dataset with elbow method for selecting the appropiate value of K

## Assignment 8
1. Clustering on **IRIS** dataset using self organising map (built from scratch) and evaluating the clustering using silhouette score (built from scratch)
2. Evaluating and comparing the performance of k-mean and SOM (self organising map) clustering on the **IRIS** dataset.

## Assignment 9
1. Classfication on **IRIS** dataset using Support vector machine model (In-built library function used)
2. Classification on **IRIS** dataset using Radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) (built from scratch)
